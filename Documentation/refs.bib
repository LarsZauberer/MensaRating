	title = {The Effects of Memory Replay in Reinforcement Learning},
	abstract = {Experience replay is a key technique behind many recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. Allowing the agent to learn from earlier memories can speed up learning and break undesirable temporal correlations. Despite its widespread application, very little is understood about the properties of experience replay. How does the amount of memory kept affect learning dynamics? Does it help to prioritize certain experiences? In this paper, we address these questions by formulating a dynamical systems {ODE} model of Q-learning with experience replay. We derive analytic solutions of the {ODE} for a simple setting. We show that even in this very simple setting, the amount of memory kept can substantially affect the agent’s performance—too much or too little memory both slow down learning. Moreover, we characterize regimes where prioritized replay harms the agent’s learning. We show that our analytic solutions have excellent agreement with experiments. Finally, we propose a simple algorithm for adaptively changing the memory buffer size which achieves consistently good empirical performance.},

	abstract = {Doodling is a useful and common intelligent skill that people can learn and master. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework to teach a machine to doodle in a simulated painting environment via Stroke Demonstration and deep Q-learning ({SDQ}). The developed system, Doodle-{SDQ}, generates a sequence of pen actions to reproduce a reference drawing and mimics the behavior of human painters. In the first stage, it learns to draw simple strokes by imitating in supervised fashion from a set of strokeaction pairs collected from artist paintings. In the second stage, it is challenged to draw real and more complex doodles without ground truth actions; thus, it is trained with Qlearning. Our experiments confirm that (1) doodling can be learned without direct stepby- step action supervision and (2) pretraining with stroke demonstration via supervised learning is important to improve performance. We further show that Doodle-{SDQ} is effective at producing plausible drawings in different media types, including sketch and watercolor.},

	abstract = {Evolution has a key role to play as we push towards Artificial General Intelligence ({AGI}), mainly for three reasons. Firstly the neural evolution and the evolutionary algorithms communities have developed a lot of important ideas that have a role to play in general {AI} research whether or not they ultimately are used on an evolutionary backbone or they're hybridized with other ideas. Secondly evolutionary algorithms themselves may be a key technology for evolution in terms of having a part to play in the overall solution to {AI}. Third, to some extent these names for different fields are metaphorical and so if one thinks about evolution a little bit more broadly as the outer loop learning algorithm which is to say that we have something that kind of moves and learns across generations and then something that learns within a lifetime that outer loop which in nature is evolution and in machine learning sometimes is specifically an evolutionary algorithm or sometimes could be, say reinforcement learning algorithm that outer loop that is definitely going to be critical as we push towards {AGI} and some will call evolution, and some will fail to call it evolution. But at its heart, we're taking inspiration from natural evolution and evolutionary algorithms to do that outer loop activity, and that's essential. So in many different ways, evolutionary algorithms are going to be essential to our push towards {AI}, and we will increasingly see that the machine learning community is starting to take note and play with a lot of the ideas from evolution under its various interpretations and definitions.

	abstract = {In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.
The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data.  The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss. Cross-validation is often used to estimate this generalization performance.},

	abstract = {Q-learning is arguably one of the most applied representative reinforcement learning approaches and one of the off-policy strategies. Since the emergence of Q-learning, many studies have described its uses in reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence problems. However, there is an information gap as to how these powerful algorithms can be leveraged and incorporated into general artificial intelligence workflow. Early Q-learning algorithms were unsatisfactory in several aspects and covered a narrow range of applications. It has also been observed that sometimes, this rather powerful algorithm learns unrealistically and overestimates the action values hence abating the overall performance. Recently with the general advances of machine learning, more variants of Q-learning like Deep Q-learning which combines basic Q learning with deep neural networks have been discovered and applied extensively. In this paper, we thoroughly explain how Q-learning evolved by unraveling the mathematical complexities behind it as well its flow from reinforcement learning family of algorithms. Improved variants are fully described, and we categorize Q-learning algorithms into single-agent and multi-agent approaches.

	abstract = {We present the ﬁrst deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We ﬁnd that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.},

Human judgment is unavoidably exercised in designing {AI} systems, and yet some of the most consequential forms of judgment are submerged in the formal rigor of algorithmic syntax. Moreover, whether or not one can conclude that the machines running {AI} themselves “make” judgments in a deep sense, human judgment is increasingly displaced by {AI} as “smart” machines perform functions that previously required the exercise of human judgment. Even promising {AI} systems designed to enhance human judgment involve subtle forms of displacement. And {AI} systems being developed in areas such as the law have powerful effects on the epistemological terrain in which human judgment occurs. This chapter describes these effects and then offers ethical, political, and legal justifications for a doctrine of non-delegation to preserve the conditions of human judgment in appropriate domains of social and legal action.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization ({BO}) is a powerful approach for seeking the global optimum of expensive black-box functions and has proven successful for fine tuning hyper-parameters of machine learning models. However, {BO} is practically limited to optimizing 10--20 parameters. To scale {BO} to high dimensions, we usually make structural assumptions on the decomposition of the objective and{\textbackslash}slash or exploit the intrinsic lower dimensionality of the problem, e.g. by using linear projections. We could achieve a higher compression rate with nonlinear projections, but learning these nonlinear embeddings typically requires much data. This contradicts the {BO} objective of a relatively small evaluation budget. To address this challenge, we propose to learn a low-dimensional feature space jointly with (a) the response surface and (b) a reconstruction mapping. Our approach allows for optimization of {BO}'s acquisition function in the lower-dimensional subspace, which significantly simplifies the optimization problem. We reconstruct the original parameter space from the lower-dimensional subspace for evaluating the black-box function. For meaningful exploration, we solve a constrained optimization problem.},

Contributing to its widespread adoption are the understandable and intuitive nature of the task, its relatively small size and storage requirements and the accessibility and ease-of-use of the database itself. The {MNIST} database was derived from a larger dataset known as the {NIST} Special Database 19 which contains digits, uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters. This paper introduces a variant of the full {NIST} dataset, which we have called Extended {MNIST} ({EMNIST}), which follows the same conversion paradigm used to create the {MNIST} dataset. The result is a set of datasets that constitute a more challenging classification tasks involving letters and digits, and that shares the same image structure and parameters as the original {MNIST} task, allowing for direct compatibility with all existing classifiers and systems. Benchmark results are presented along with a validation of the conversion process through the comparison of the classification results on converted {NIST} digits and the {MNIST} digits.},

It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger {NIST} Special Database 3 (digits written by employees of the United States Census Bureau) and Special Database 1 (digits written by high school students) which contain monochrome images of handwritten digits. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. The original black and white (bilevel) images from {NIST} were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.},
